Can you advise me on what legal steps I should take in a breach of contract situation where the other party has not fulfilled their obligations?
<|im_end|>{{ end }}{{ if .Response }}assistant
Thank you for reaching out. Let's analyze your situation.
You are facing a breach of contract where the other party has failed to meet their obligations as per the agreement.
This falls under contract law.
The initial step would be to review the contract terms and then send a formal notice of breach to the other party.
I recommend consulting with a lawyer to discuss legal options tailored to your specific case.
