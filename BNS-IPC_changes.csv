0,"IPC Section 33: The word act denotes as well as series of acts as a single act [...] changes to BNSClause 2 (1): act as well a series of acts as a single act;The Implication of revision is The definition in section 33 explained that the term act also denoted a series of acts. The definition in clause 2(1) of the BNS does not convey the same meaning, and may lead to confusion as to whether an act signifies a series of acts. In its current form, the definition
has no meaning."
1,"IPC Section 20: The words Court of Justice denote a Judge who is empowered by law to act judicially alone, or a body of Judges which is empowered by law to act judicially as a body, when such Judge or body of Judges is acting judicially. changes to BNSClause 2(4): Court means a Judge who is empowered by law to act judicially alone, or a body of Judges, which is empowered by law to act judicially as a body, when such Judge or body of Judges is acting judicially;The Implication of revision is It is not clear why this change was necessitated. Further, due to the change in the definition of judge in the BNS, some institutions presided over by quasi- judicial authorities may no longer be considered courts of justice."
2,"IPC Section 8: The pronoun he and its derivatives are used of any person, whether male or female. changes to BNSClause 2 (9): genderthe pronoun he and its derivatives are used of any person, whether male, female or transgender.
Explanation. transgender shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (k) of section 2 of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019;The Implication of revision is While the definition is now more inclusive, it will have no practical implication unless specific offences applicable to transgender persons are defined/created. For instance, the Justice Verma Committee had recommended that victims in sexual offences be gender- neutral, with the objective that trans persons be covered within the definition of rape. That change was neither made in 2013 when the rape laws were amended, nor has it been made in the BNS. Further, there are no offences relating to specific targeting of trans persons due to their gender identity. This is further exacerbated by the fact that they have historically been one of the most persecuted and criminalised
communities in India."
3,"IPC Section 19: The word Judge denotes not only every person who is officially designated as a Judge, but also every person who is empowered by law to give, in any legal proceeding, civil or criminal, a definitive judgment, or a judgment which, if not appealed against, would be definitive, or a judgment which, if confirmed by some other authority, would be definitive, or who is one of a body or persons, which body of persons is empowered by law to give such a judgment. Illustrations: (a) A Collector exercising jurisdiction in a suit under Act 10 of 1859 is a Judge. (b) A Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in respect of a charge on which he has power to sentence to fine or imprisonment, with or without appear, is a Judge. (c) A member of a panchayat which has power, under 4Regulation VII, 1816, of the Madras Code, to try and determine suits, is a Judge. (d) A Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in respect of a charge on which he has power only to commit for trial to another Court, is not a
Judge. changes to BNSClause 2(15):  Judge means a person who is officially designated as a Judge and includes a person,(i) who is empowered by law to give, in any legal proceeding, civil or criminal, a definitive judgment, or a judgment which, if not appealed against, would be definitive, or a judgment which, if confirmed by some other authority, would be definitive; or (ii) who is one of a body or persons, which body of persons is empowered by law to give such a judgment. Illustration: A Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in respect of a charge on which he has power to sentence to fine or imprisonment, with or without appeal, is a Judge;The Implication of revision is The change proposed by the definition in the BNS appears to exclude quasi- judicial authorities. This may make the defence under section 15, BNS unavailable to quasi-judicial authorities. Under the IPC, the defence under section 77 was available to quasi-judicial authorities. These provisions save a Judge from criminal liability when acting judicially in exercise of their powers."
4,"IPC No equivalent provision in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 2(19): mental illness shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (a) of section 2 of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017;The Implication of revision is This is an error since clause (a) of Section 2 of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 does not define mental illness. The reference ought to be to clause (s) of Section 2, which reads: mental illness means a substantial disorder of thinking, mood, perception, orientation or memory that grossly impairs judgment, behaviour, capacity to recognise reality or ability to meet the ordinary demands of life, mental conditions associated with the abuse of alcohol and drugs, but does not include mental retardation which is a condition of arrested or incomplete development of mind of a person, specially characterised by subnormality
of intelligence."
5,"IPC Section 22: The words movable property are intended to include corporeal property of every description, except land and things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything
which is attached to the earth. changes to BNSClause 2(21): movable property includes property of every description, except land and things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything which is attached
to the earth;The Implication of revision is The definition of movable property is now no longer confined to corporeal property. It remains unclear as to whether incorporeal property of every kind is included with the definition of movable property."
6,"IPC Section 51: The word oath includes a solemn affirmation substituted by law for an oath, and anydeclaration required or authorised by law to be made before a public servant or to be used for the purposeof proof, whether in a Court of Justice or
not. changes to BNSClause 2(23): oath includes a solemn affirmation substituted by law for an oath, and any declaration required or authorised by law to be made before a public servant or to be used for the purpose of proof, whether in a Court or not;The Implication of revision is The implication of this change is similar to what is discussed in Clause 2(4) of the BNS. Oaths taken before quasi-judicial authorities may no longer be covered under this provision."
7,"IPC Section 21: Explanation 3  The word election denotes an election for the purpose of selecting members of any legislative, municipal or other public authority, of whatever character, the method of selection to which is by, or under, any law prescribed as by election. changes to BNSClause 2(28)(k) Explanation (c): 'election means an election for the purpose of selecting members of any legislative, municipal or other public authority, of whatever character, the method of election to which is by, or under any law for the time being in forceThe Implication of revision is The Explanation appears incomplete."
8,"IPC No equivalent provision in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 4: The punishments of which offenders are liable under the provisions of this Sanhita are:...(f) Community
ServiceThe Implication of revision is Community Service has been added as a possible form of punishment under the BNS. It remains unclear precisely what this form of punishment would entail
and how it would be administered."
9,"IPC Section 57: In calculating fractions of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years. changes to BNSClause 6: In calculating fractions of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be recokned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years unless otherwise provided.The Implication of revision is Previously, where punishments had to be calculated through fractions of a life imprisonment term, such a term would be considered equal to twenty years. The addition of unless otherwise provided empowers the Legislature to specify that life imprisonment terms can be considered equivalent to more or less than twenty years of imprisonment in
certain cases."
10,"IPC Section 84: Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. changes to BNSClause 22: Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of mental illness, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to lawThe Implication of revision is The definition of mental illness in Section 2(s) of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 is both broad, and restrictive. For instance, it excludes mental retardation, which is defined as a condition of arrested or incomplete development of mind of a person, specially characterised by subnormality of intelligence. Such a person may not have the capacity to  form knowledge, and hence get excluded from the benefit of clause 22 of the BNS. On the other hand, the breadth of the definition may also make it overinclusive, i.e. include individuals who would earlier not have got the benefit of section 84, IPC. However, since the test under the new provision remains unchanged, the standards used for its invocation would still apply. Therefore, the stereotypes associated with Sec. 84 of
the IPC would continue."
11,"IPC Section 85: Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. changes to BNSClause 23: Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to law; unless that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his
will.The Implication of revision is Replacing provided that with unless that completely changes the meaning of the intoxication defence. It makes voluntary intoxication a defence."
12,"IPC Section 89: Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound mind, by or by consent, either express or  implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided Provisos.
First.That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death; Secondly.That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; Thirdly.That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt; or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; Fourthly.That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend. changes to BNSClause 27: Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of person with mental illness, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided that this exception shall not extend to
(a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death;
(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;
(c) the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;
(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not
extend.The Implication of revision is As discussed in the context of clause 22, the definition of mental illness being broad, the agency of persons with mental illness may be impacted in this case. The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 has a particular mechanism for appointment of nominated representatives, which puts the agency/capacity of the person with mental illness at the forefront."
13,"IPC Section 103: The right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntarycausing of death or of any other harm to the wrong- doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or theattempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptionshereinafter enumerated, namely:First. Robbery;Secondly.House- breaking by night;Thirdly. Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling or as a place for the custody of property;Fourthly.Theft, mischief or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not exercised. changes to BNSClause 41: The right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions specified in section 37, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:(a) robbery;(b) house-breaking after sun set and before sun rise;(c) mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property;(d) theft, mischief, or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause  apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not
exercised.The Implication of revision is The change from housebreaking by night to housebreaking after sunset and before sunrise appears unnecessary. Without reasons being provided for the change being made, it is not clear as to why this change is required. Mischief by fire has been expanded to additionally include mischief caused by explosive substances."
14,"IPC No equivalent provision in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 48: A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Sanhita who, without and beyond India, abets the commission of any act in India which would constitute an offence if committed in India. Illustration.
A, in country X, instigates B, to
commit a murder in India, A is guilty of abetting murder.The Implication of revision is This section expands the jurisdiction of the Act in respect of abetment of offences to include people who are outside of India, but can be linked to the commission of an offence within India.
Such persons can now be proceeded against under the Act."
15,"IPC No equivalent provision in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 69: Whoever, by deceitful means or making by promise to marry to a woman without any intention of fulfilling the same, and has sexual intercourse with her, such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation. deceitful means shall include the false promise of employment or promotion, inducement or marring after suppressing identity.The Implication of revision is This brings in a new offence of deceitful sexual intercourse. The terminology usednot amounting to rapecreates confusion. This term is used earlier in Section 376C of the IPC (now clause 68, BNS) and covers situations where there was consent at the time of sexual intercourse, which was not vitiated.
Section 376C and 68, BNS are meant to prohibit sexual relations between people of particular relationships. However, in this clause, deceit conceptually vitiates consent; so does breach of promise which involves the accused not having any intention of going through with the promise. Hence, the meaning of not amounting to rape is not clear. It could possibly mean that the offence is not rape, or that if a person is acquitted of rape, they can still be prosecuted and punished under this section. Further, all others sections in this chapter that use the term sexual intercourse (such as Clause 67 and 68) define it to mean sexual acts beyond penile-vaginal penetration. Using the term sexual intercourse without defining it means that it covers only penile-vaginal penetration. Furthermore, unlike other sections in this chapter, there is no minimum punishment under this  section, and the maximum punishment
prescribed is 10 years."
16,"IPC Section 376DA: Where a woman under sixteen years of age is raped by one or more persons constituting a group or acting in furtherance of a common intention, each of those persons shall be deemed to have committed the offence of rape  and shall be punished with imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life, and with fine: Provided that such fine shall be just and reasonable to meet the medical expenses and rehabilitation of the
victim: Provided further that any changes to BNSClause 70(2): Where a woman under eighteen years of age is raped by one or more persons constituting a group or acting in furtherance of a common intention, each of those persons shall be deemed to have committed the offence of rape and shall be punished with imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the
remainder of that persons natural life, and with fine, or with death:Provided that such fine shall be just and
reasonable to meet the medicalThe Implication of revision is Changing the age from 16 years to 18 years expands the scope of the provision to include those offenders who commit gangrape on women between 16 to 18 years of age. Additionally, this offence is now punishable with the death penalty. This also explains why Section 376 DB (which prescribed the punishment for gangrape of a woman under twelve years of age) has now been deleted, as the offences under that provision are now included within the scope of Clause 70(2)."
17,"IPC 377. Unnatural offences. Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with [imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the
offence described in this section. changes to BNSNo equivalent provision in the BNS.The Implication of revision is The BNS repeals section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 377, to the extent that it covered consensual sexual acts was held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Navtej Johar v. Union of India. However, section 377 also covered cases of forced sexual acts against men, trans persons, and animals. By removing
section 377 altogether, the BNS no longer provides legal remedy for non- consensual sexual acts against men, trans persons, and animals. A separate section needed to be introduced to cover such
cases."
18,"IPC Section 354B: Any man who assaults or uses criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing or compelling her to
be naked, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. changes to BNSClause 75: Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing or compelling her to be naked, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years, and shall also be
liable to fine.The Implication of revision is This makes the offence gender neutral qua the offender."
19,"IPC Section 354C: Any man who watches, or captures the image of changes to BNSClause 76: Whoever watches, or captures the image of aThe Implication of revision is This makes the offence of voyeurism gender neutral qua the offender."
20,"IPC Section 509: Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any words, makes
any sound or gesture, or exhibits changes to BNSClause 78: Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any words,
makes any sound or gesture,The Implication of revision is The insertion of the phrase in any form expands the scope of the object indicated. However, without any explanation, it"
21,"IPC any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen, by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and also with fine. changes to BNSor exhibits any object in any form, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen, by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to three
years, and also with fine.The Implication of revision is remains unclear as to why such expansion was necessary."
22,"IPC Section 498: Whoever takes or entices away any woman who is and whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of any other man, from that man, or from any person having the care of her on behalf of that man, with intent that she may have illicit intercourse with any person, or conceals or detains with that intent any such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years,
or with fine, or with both. changes to BNSClause 83: Whoever takes or entices away any woman who is and whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of any other man, with intent that she may have illicit intercourse with any person, or conceals or detains with that intent any such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.The Implication of revision is The deletion of the phrase from that man, or from any person having the care of her on behalf of that man broadens the scope of the section inasmuch as where, or from whom, the woman is enticed becomes irrelevant to the offence. Further, while the exclusion serves to remove some patriarchal notions from the code, the section in its entirety still continues to be patriarchal since it takes away the agency of the woman in question."
23,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 93: Whoever hires, employs or engages any person below the age of eighteen years to commit an offence shall be punished with imprisonment of either description or fine provided for that offence as if the offence has been committed by such person himself.
Explanation.Hiring, employing, engaging or using a child for sexual exploitation or pornography is covered within the meaning of this
section.The Implication of revision is This is a new provision which criminalises hiring/employing/engaging a minor to commit an offence. However, the explanation to the section is unclear since in a case of hiring, employing, engaging or using a child for sexual exploitation or pornography the child will be a victim, whereas the clause suggests that the child is committing an offence on the instructions of the primary offender."
24,"IPC Section 366A: Whoever, by any means whatsoever, induces any minor girl under the age of eighteen years to go from any place or to do any act with intent that such girl may be, or knowing that it is likely that she will be, changes to BNSClause 94: Whoever, by any means whatsoever, induces any child below the age of eighteen years to go from any place or to do any act with intent that such child below the age of eighteen years mayThe Implication of revision is This provision has been made gender neutral."
25,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 101(2): When a group of five or more persons acting in concert commits murder on the ground of race, caste or community, sex, place of birth, language, personal belief or any other ground each member of such group shall be punished with death or with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years, and shall also be
liable to fine.The Implication of revision is This section appears to introduce an aggravated form of murder committed by a group of 5 or more persons acting in concert, and with a specific intent in mind. It provides for a minimum punishment of 7 years, and a maximum of death. At the outset, the meaning of the term acting in concert is undefined. Furthermore, a lesser minimum punishment for an aggravated offence does not adhere to established penological policy."
26,"IPC Section 303: Whoever, being under sentence of imprisonment for life, commits murder shall be punished with death. changes to BNSClause 102: Whoever, being under sentence of imprisonment for life, commits murder, shall be punished with death or with imprisonment for life, which shall mean the remainder of
that persons natural life.The Implication of revision is Section 303 was struck down by the Supreme Court in Mithu v. State of Punjab. It has been reintroduced in the form of Clause 102, with a modification that allows for a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of remission."
27,"IPC Section 304: Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to changes to BNSClause 103: Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and with fine, if the act is done
with the knowledge that it isThe Implication of revision is This provision introduces a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. Additionally, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder where the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, fine has been made mandatory."
28,"IPC Section 304A: Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. changes to BNSClause 104(1): Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.The Implication of revision is This increases the punishment for rash/negligent homicide from 2 years to 7 years. In the past, there has been a debate on whether 2 years maximum imprisonment for Section 304A is too little. This amendment accordingly increases the punishment, which remains lesser than the maximum punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to
murder, which is conceptually fine."
29,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 104(2): Whoever causes death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide and escapes from the scene of incident or fails to report the incident to a Police officer or Magistrate soon after the incident, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description of a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.The Implication of revision is This section introduces an offence of escaping from the scene of a rash/negligent homicide committed by the offender. It also criminalises failure to report the crime after committing it. It is an aggravated form of the offence punished under section 104(1), since it provides a maximum punishment of 10 years. This appears to cover cases of hit and run in cases of vehicular homicides. It also covers all rash/negligent homicides where the offender escapes from the scene of crime or does not report the crime to the
police/Magistrate."
30,"IPC Section 305: If any person under eighteen years of age, any insane person, any delirious person, any idiot, or any person in a state of intoxication, commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. changes to BNSClause 105: If any person under eighteen years of age, any person with mental illness, any delirious person or any person in a state of intoxication, commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, and shall
also be liable to fine.The Implication of revision is Replacing the words any insane person and any idiot, with any person with mental illness expands the scope of the section and would cover a larger number of people within the aggravated offence as opposed to the offence under Section 306/Clause 106. Under the IPC, most cases of abetment of suicide are adjudicated under Section
306. However, inclusion of a broad term like mental illness in this context would mean that this provision is invoked more
frequently."
31,"IPC Section 307 (paragraph 2): When any person offending under this section is under sentence of imprisonment for life, he may, if changes to BNSClause 107(2): When any person offending under sub-section (1) is under sentence of imprisonment 45 for life, he may, if hurt is caused, be
punished with death or withThe Implication of revision is In addition to the death penalty, the new provision has an alternative punishment of life imprisonment which extends to the whole of natural life of the convict without the possibility of remission."
32,"IPC Section 309: Whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or
with fine, or with both. changes to BNSNo equivalent section in the BNS.The Implication of revision is This provision was, in effect, repealed by way of Section 115 of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. It has been removed from the text of the BNS."
33,"IPC Section 310: Whoever, at any time after the passing of this Act, shall have been habitually associated with any other or others for the purpose of committing robbery or child-stealing by means of or accompanied with murder, is a
thug. changes to BNSNo equivalent section in the BNS.The Implication of revision is This is a positive change. This provision previously criminalised people based on their caste and status, such as nomads, etc."
34,"IPC Section 311: Whoever is a thug, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine. changes to BNSNo equivalent section in the BNS.The Implication of revision is This is a positive change. People were defined as thugs and criminalised based on belonging to the community."
35,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 109(1): Any continuing unlawful activity including kidnapping, robbery, vehicle theft, extortion, land grabbing, contract killing, economic offences, cyber-crimes having severe consequences, trafficking in people, drugs, illicit goods or services and weapons, human trafficking racket for prostitution or ransom by the effort of groups of individuals acting in concert, singly or jointly, either as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate, by use of violence, threat of violence, intimidation, coercion, corruption or related activities or other unlawful means to obtain direct or indirect, material benefit including a financial benefit, shall
constitute organised crime.The Implication of revision is This section introduces a new offence of organised crime in the IPC. However, given the manner in which it is worded, without appropriate punctuation marks or sub-sections, it creates confusion on which offences are covered within the ambit of organised crime. For instance, there is a reference to human trafficking racket for prostitution or ransom. What human trafficking for ransom implies is unclear. It also states: by the effort of groups or individuals acting in concert, singly or jointly. It is not clear what is implied by individuals acting in concert, but singly. Further, the phrase cyber crimes having severe consequences has not been defined."
36,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 109(1) Explanation: For the purposes of this subsection...: (ii) organised crime syndicate means a criminal organisation or group of three or more persons who, acting either singly or collectively in concert, as a syndicate, gang, mafia, or crime ring indulging in commission of one or more serious offences orinvolved in gang criminality, racketeering, and syndicated organised
crime;The Implication of revision is Some elements of this definition seem to have been borrowed from the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 and other similar organised crime statutes in other states. However, it also introduces certain new elements in the provision, which render the provision vague and unclear."
37,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 109(1) Explanation: For the purposes of this subsection...: (iii) continuing unlawful activity means an activity prohibited by law, which is a cognizable offence undertaken either singly or jointly, as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate in respect of which more than one charge-sheets have been filed before a competent court within the preceding period of ten years and that court has taken cognizance of such
offence.The Implication of revision is This definition has been borrowed from the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 and other similar organised crime statutes in other states."
38,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 109(2): Whoever, attempts to commit or  commits an offence of organised crime shall,(i) if such offence has resulted in  the death of any person, be punishable with death or imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than rupees ten lakhs;(ii) in any other case, be punishable with imprisonment for a term  which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life
and shall also be liable to fineThe Implication of revision is The punishment for attempt to commit the offence and the punishment for actual commission of the offence under this provision is the same. The distinction is instead drawn on the basis of whether a death is caused or not. In the former case, the offence is punishable with imprisonment for life or death.
Otherwise, there is a mandatory minimum sentence of five years, extendable to life imprisonment."
39,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 109(3): Whoever, conspires or organises the commission of an organised crime, or assists, facilitates or otherwise engages in any act preparatory to an organised crime, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term  which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than rupees five lakhs.The Implication of revision is This clause deals with conspiracies, organising the commission of an organised crime, assisting and facilitating organised crime or engaging in preparatory acts. The terms used are wide and vague. For instance, the ambit of preparatory acts may be very wide, thus bringing within the section people who may not even have the relevant intention or knowledge that they are engaging in an act preparatory to an organised crime. From a penological perspective, the clause provides the same punishment for conspiracy and abetment, as it does for membership,
thus equating these offences."
40,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 109(4): Any person  who is a member of an organised crime syndicate shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term  which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than rupees five lakhs.The Implication of revision is This section is taken from the MCOCA. The punishment is also the same.

rupees two lakhs.The Implication of revision is This section is taken from MCOCA, save for the term proceeds of any organised crime, which has been defined in the explanation. The proviso is from UAPA. The jurisprudence from these legislations will apply."

44,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 109: Explanation. For the purposes of this section, proceeds of any organised crime means all kind of properties which have been derived or obtained from commission of any organised crime or have acquired through funds traceable to any organised crime and shall include cash, irrespective of person in whose name such proceeds are standing or in whose possession they are
found.The Implication of revision is This provides a broad definition to the term proceeds of an organized crime, and can thus be overinclusive. Currently, there is debate and criticism of similar provisions in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which have not been taken into consideration while drafting this clause of the BNS."
45,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 110. (1) Any crime that causes general feelings of insecurity among citizens relating to theft of vehicle or theft from vehicle, domestic and business theft, trick theft, cargo crime, theft (attempt to theft, theft of personal property), organised pick pocketing, snatching, theft through shoplifting or card skimming and Automated Teller Machine thefts or procuring money in unlawful manner in public transport system or illegal selling of tickets and selling of public examination question papers and such other common forms of organised crime committed by organised criminal groups or gangs, shall constitute petty organised crimes and shall
include the said crimes whenThe Implication of revision is This provision has vague and broad terms such as general feelings of insecurity among citizens. It also consists of terms such as mobile organised crime groups. This may lead to criminalisation of individuals/groups who are nomadic, which is was the rationale behind the repealed Criminal Tribes Act."
46,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNS(2) Whoever commits or attempts to commit any petty organised crime, under sub- section (1) shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to seven years, and

110(1). Like in Clause 109(2) the punishment for attempting the crime, and for committing the crime, is identical."
47,"IPC No equivalent section in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 111(1): A person is said to have committed a terrorist act if he commits any act in India or in any foreign country with the intention to threaten the unity, integrity and security of India, to intimidate the general public or a segment thereof, or to disturb

48,"IPC No corresponding provision in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 111(2): Whoever, attempts to commit or commits an offence of terrorist act shall,(i) if such offence has resulted in the death of any person, be punishable with death or imprisonment for life without the benefit of parole, and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than rupees ten lakhs;(ii) in any other case, be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less
than rupees five lakhs.The Implication of revision is A large part of Clause 111(2) is taken from Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.
However, in 111 (2) (i), life imprisonment has been specifically enhanced to exclude parole. Additionally fine amounts have been mentioned in the section which is absent in the UAPA. The punishment under this provision is more stringent than corresponding provisions of the UAPA."

than rupees five lakhs.The Implication of revision is Clause 111(3) is taken from Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. However, punishment under this provision specifically mentions a fine amount which is absent in the UAPA."
50,"IPC No corresponding provision in the IPC changes to BNSClause 111(4): Any person, who is a member of terrorist organisation, which is involved in terrorist act, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine which shall
not be less than rupees five lakhs.The Implication of revision is Clause 111(4) is taken from Section 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. However, punishment under this provision specifically mentions a fine amount which is absent in the UAPA."
51,"IPC No corresponding provision in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 111 (5) Whoever, intentionally harbours or conceals or attempts to harbour or conceal any person who has committed an offence of any terrorist act shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than rupees five lakh: Provided that this sub-section shall not apply to any case in which the harbour or concealment is by the spouse
of the offender.The Implication of revision is Clause 111(5) is largely taken from Section 19 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. However, punishment under this provision specifically mentions a fine amount which is absent in the UAPA. This section brings in an element of intention in the context of harbouring/concealing a person who has committed a terrorist act. This is different from the UAPA which requires knowledge that the person being harboured is a terrorist. Doing away  with this requirement may have the impact of broadening the section as compared to section 19 of the UAPA."
52,"IPC No corresponding provision in the IPC. changes to BNSClause 111 (6): Whoever, holds any property directly or indirectly, derived or obtained from commission of terrorist act or proceeds of terrorism, or acquired through the terrorist fund, or possesses, provides, collects or uses property or funds or makes available property, funds or financial service or other related services, by any means, to be used, in full or in part to carry out or facilitate the commission of any terrorist act, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than rupees five lakhs and such property shall also be liable for
attachment and forfeiture.The Implication of revision is The first part of Clause 111 (6) is borrowed from Sec. 21 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. This provision broadens the scope for criminalisation of acts beyond those of Sec. 21 of the UAPA."

Twenty days (two thirds of a month) has been changed to fifteen days in the BNS. The logic for reduction from twenty days to fifteen days is not clear."
55,"IPC No corresponding provision in the IPC changes to BNSClause 115 (3) Whoever commits an offence under sub- section (1) and in the course of such commission causes any hurt to a person which causes that person to be in permanent disability or in persistent vegetative state, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that persons
natural life.The Implication of revision is This provision introduces an aggravated form of the offence of grievous hurt, with an increased mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. This would have been punishable previously with a maximum sentence of seven years."
56,"IPC No corresponding provision in the IPC changes to BNSClause115 (4) When grievous hurt of a person is caused by a group of five or more persons on the ground of his, race, caste, sex, place of birth, language, personal belief or any other ground, each member of such group shall be guilty of the offence of causing grievous hurt, and shall be
punished with imprisonmentThe Implication of revision is This clause appears to criminalise participation in the offence wherein grievous hurt is caused by a group on the grounds of race, caste, sex, etc. It is not clear whether there is a requirement of common intention, or the group needs to share a common object. This vagueness may cause confusion."

shall also be liable to fine.The Implication of revision is Section 121A of the IPC used the phrase within or without India. This covered acts committed in India and outside India. The word beyond has now been added. It does not appear to make any difference and is hence, superfluous."
64,"IPC Section 124A: Whoever by words, either spoken or written, signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, the Government established by law  in India, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, to which fine may be added, or with imprisonment which may extend to three years, to which fine may be added, or with fine.Explanation 1.The expression disaffection includes disloyalty and all feelings of enmity.Explanation 2. Comments expressing disapprobation of the measures of the Government with a view to obtain their alteration by lawful means, without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute an offence under this section.Explanation 3. Comments expressing disapprobation of the administrative or other action of the Government without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute an offence under this

The use of vague phrases such as exciting secessionist activities and feelings could potentially criminalise activities which do not have any overt act. Further, the use of the word purposely introduces an ambiguous standard of mental state. The jurisprudence on sedition had limited the extent of the provision to words which lead to immediate violence. This leads to further expansion of the scope of the provision. Moreover, the explanation appears to be incomplete. However, if read as it is, it can further broaden the ambit of the section."

(1) Whoever, by words either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representations or through electronic communication or otherwise, ...(d) makes or publishes false or misleading information jeopardising the sovereignty unity and integrity

They will not be prosecuted and punished under section 309 of the IPC. With section 309 no longer included in the BNS, Clause 224 draws out an exception wherein a person who attempts to die by suicide with the intent to compel or restraining a public servant from discharging their official duty shall be punished.

consequence."

(2) Whoever commits snatching, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and
shall also be liable to fine.The Implication of revision is It remains unclear as to what distinguishes this offence from theft simpliciter, especially since the punishment is the same. Particularly, the phrase takes away makes it very similar to the offence of theft as defined in the previous provision."

This new section specifically adds property belonging to the Government or Local Authority, and punishes the act with a maximum of one
year."

The IPCs logic was to criminalise the killing of animals which were of value to someone, possibly covering domesticated animals killed by a third person without the consent of the owner of the animal. Clause 323, by removing the value of the animal, appears to criminalise the killing of any animal, domesticated or otherwise. In light other legislations such as the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, etc., this section should have ideally been repealed."
